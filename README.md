# üîê Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows/Linux

## üéØ Objective

Configure and test basic firewall rules to **allow** or **block** network traffic using UFW (Linux) or Windows Firewall.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Used

- **OS:** Parrot OS (Linux), Windows 7 (VM), Windows 11.
- **Tool:** UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall),  Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.


---

# In Linux

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

### ‚úÖ 1. Enabled UFW

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Listed existing rules

```bash
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw status numbered
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Blocked Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)

```bash
sudo ufw deny 23
```

### ‚úÖ 4. Allowed SSH (port 22)

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
```

### ‚úÖ 5. Tested the Block Rule

```bash
telnet localhost 23
nmap -p 23 localhost
```

### ‚úÖ 6. Removed the test rule

```bash
sudo ufw delete deny 23
```
# In Windows

 ## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

### ‚úÖ 1. Opened Firewall Configuration

- Opened `Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security` from Start Menu.

### ‚úÖ 2. Listed Current Inbound Rules

- Navigated to **Inbound Rules** in the left pane to view existing rules.

### ‚úÖ 3. Blocked Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)

- Clicked on **New Rule > Port > TCP > Specific local ports: 23**
- Selected **Block the connection**
- Applied to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
- Named the rule: `Block_Telnet_Port_23`

### ‚úÖ 4. Tested the Block Rule

- Used `telnet localhost 23` to test connectivity.
- Also verified using `nmap` from another machine:
  ```bash
  nmap -p 23 <Windows-IP>
  ```
  ### ‚úÖ 5. Allowed SSH (Optional - Port 22)

  - Created a rule to allow SSH if needed:
    - New Rule > Port > TCP > Port 22 > Allow the connection.

 ### ‚úÖ 6. Removed the Test Block Rule

  - Went back to **Inbound Rules**.
  - Right-click on `Block_Telnet_Port_23` and selected **Delete**.
