# üîê Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows/Linux

## üéØ Objective

Configure and test basic firewall rules to **allow** or **block** network traffic using UFW (Linux) or Windows Firewall.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Used

- **OS:** Parrot OS (Linux), Windows 7 (VM), Windows 11.
- **Tool:** UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall),  Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

# In Linux

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

### ‚úÖ 1. Enabled UFW

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

### 2. Listed existing rules

```bash
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw status numbered
```

### 3. Blocked Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)

```bash
sudo ufw deny 23
```

### 4. Allowed SSH (port 22)

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
```

### 5. Tested the Block Rule

```bash
telnet localhost 23
nmap -p 23 localhost
```

### 6. Removed the test rule

```bash
sudo ufw delete deny 23
```

## ## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots

All screenshots of the above steps are available in the `/screenshots` folder, including:

- Firewall status before/after
    
- Port 23 block confirmation
    
- UFW commands execution


## üß† Key Learnings

- Learned how to **list**, **add**, and **remove** firewall rules using UFW.
    
- Understood the concept of **inbound/outbound** traffic control.
    
- Practiced basic **network traffic filtering** using port numbers.
    
- Realized the importance of **allowing SSH (port 22)** while working on Linux firewalls to avoid losing remote access.
